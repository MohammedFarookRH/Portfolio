## 💻 Local Development Setup

> **Prerequisite:** Node.js & npm must be installed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for easy version management.

Follow these steps to run the project locally using your preferred IDE:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate into the project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install dependencies
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Your app will now be running with auto-reloading and live preview.
